This publication has been prepared under a mandate given to the 
European Standards Organizations by the European Commission and the 
European Free Trade Association. It is intended to support requirements 
of the EU legislation detailed in the European Foreword. A European 
Annex, usually Annex ZA or ZZ, describes how this publication relates to 
that EU legislation.
For the Great Britain market (England, Scotland and Wales), if UK 
Government has designated this publication for conformity with UKCA 
marking (or similar) legislation, it may contain an additional National 
Annex. Where such a National Annex exists, it shows the correlation 
between this publication and the relevant UK legislation. If there is no 
National Annex of this kind, the relevant Annex ZA or ZZ in the body 
of the European text will indicate the relationship to UK regulation 
applicable in Great Britain. References to EU legislation may need to be 
read in accordance with the UK designation and the applicable UK law.

Introduction 
Vigilance is required from manufacturers to improve the overall resilience against cybersecurity threats 
caused by the increased connectivity of radio equipment [34] and the growing ability of malicious threat 
actors to cause harm to users, organizations, and society.  
The security requirements presented in this baseline standard are developed to improve the ability of 
radio equipment to protect its security and financial assets against common cybersecurity threats and to 
mitigate publicly known exploitable vulnerabilities. 
It is important to note that to achieve the overall cybersecurity of radio equipment, defence in depth best 
practices will be needed by both the manufacturer and user. In particular, no single measure will suffice 
to achieve the given objectives, indeed achieving even a single security objective will usually require a 
suite of mechanisms and measures. Throughout this document, the guidance material includes lists of 
examples. These examples given are only indicative possibilities, as there are other possibilities that are 
not listed, and even using the examples given will not be sufficient unless the mechanisms and measures 
chosen are implemented in a coordinated fashion.

5 Application of this document 
This document uses the concept of mechanisms to instruct the user of this document when to apply 
certain security measures. Mechanisms address the applicability and appropriateness through a set of 
requirements including assessment criteria. An applicable/non-applicable decision is taken for each of 
the items specified. If applicable it is followed by a pass/fail appropriateness decision for each of the items 
specified. For example, when checking the applicability of a requirement on external interfaces, then the 
decision whether the requirement needs to be fulfilled is determined for each external interface 
independently. 
The mechanisms and their application are documented using the structure shown in the table below:

The assessments are conducted by examining the documented assessment cases, not all assessment cases 
might be provided for every mechanism: 
— Conceptual assessment 
Examine if the provided documentation and rationale provide the required evidence (for example 
the rationale why a mechanism is not applicable for a specific network interface). 
— Functional completeness assessment 
Examine and test if the provided documentation is complete (for example use network scanners 
to verify that all external interfaces are properly identified, documented and assessed) 
— Functional sufficiency assessment

Examine and test if the implementation is adequate (for example run fuzzing tools on a network 
interface to check if it is resilient to attacks with malformed data) 
Each of the assessments is further divided into the following sub-clauses which might use a decision tree 
to guide the assessment:

6 Requirements 
6.1 [ACM] Access control mechanism 
6.1.1 [ACM-1] Applicability of access control mechanisms 
6.1.1.1 
Requirement 
The equipment shall use access control mechanisms to manage entities' access to security assets and 
financial assets, except for access to security assets or financial assets where: 
— public accessibility is the equipment’s intended functionality; or 
— physical or logical measures in the equipment’s targeted operational environment limit their 
accessibility to authorized entities; or 
— legal implications do not allow for access control mechanisms. 
6.1.1.2 
Rationale 
Security and financial assets might be exposed to unauthorized access attempts. Access control 
mechanisms limit the ability of any unauthorized entity to access these assets. 
6.1.1.3 
Guidance  
The requirement does not demand access control mechanisms on assets that it does not cover (for 
example, the dispense button on a coffee machine). Further it does not demand access control 
mechanisms for security assets or financial assets that are in principle covered, but where the intended 
equipment functionality [36] is to be generally accessible by the public or where the intended operational 
environment of use ensures that only authorized access is possible. If the equipment relies on the access 
control given by the intended operational environment, it is to be ensured that this access control is 
appropriate as described in ACM-2. 
Radio interfaces might be accessible even if the equipment is in an environment preventing physical 
manipulation by an unauthorized entity, for instance a wireless network is often accessible from outside 
a user’s home. 
For example, depending on the equipment’s technical properties, intended equipment functionality and 
intended operational environment of use access control mechanisms might not be necessary for relevant 
security assets or financial assets where: 
— all entities with access to the equipment (the equipment is intended to be operated in an area 
which has physical access control) are authorized to access these assets (for example, the WPS 
button on a home router); 
— the equipment’s functionality only provides information (on security assets or financial 
assets) that is intended to be publicly accessible (for instance broadcasting Bluetooth 
advertising beacons). 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
17 
Access control mechanisms need properties to tie access rights to. Such properties can amongst others 
be: 
— verified claims of entities (for instance being owner of a user account, member of specific 
group, authorized by another entity); 
— certain states of the equipment or the equipment’s environment (for instance an electronic 
flight bag might have different access rights for a local user when it is operated in the air, than 
when it is stored at the ground); 
— the external interface an access is performed from (for instance a local access, where physical 
access control is obviously in place, might have different access rights than a remote access); 
— various combinations of the properties mentioned, as well as additional ones.

6.1.2 [ACM-2] Appropriate access control mechanisms 
6.1.2.1 
Requirement  
Access control mechanisms that are required per ACM-1 shall ensure that only authorized entities have 
access to the protected security assets and financial assets. 
6.1.2.2 
Rationale  
Security assets and financial assets may be exposed by unauthorized access attempts. Appropriate access 
control mechanisms ensure these assets are protected from unauthorized access. 
6.1.2.3 
Guidance  
This requirement is intended to ensure that the access control mechanisms used to protect the relevant 
security assets or financial assets are chosen and configured such that unauthorized access is denied. 
With a variety of asset access methods and control mechanisms (for instance display on a wearable’s 
screen), equipment use-cases and operational environments, it is difficult to specify a generic model for 
entities and associated access rights. 
Whether an access control mechanism can deny unauthorized access, always depends on external 
assumptions that need to be fulfilled. For example, that the sharing of passwords or unauthorized 
physical access are not permitted. 
Depending on the equipment’s technical properties, intended operational environment of use, the access 
control mechanisms use appropriate properties to tie access rights to and that all involved entities are 
provided with authorization information. 
When access control mechanisms rely on authentication mechanisms, see AUM, for example: 
— an authorized entity, e.g., specific human, owner of a user account, device, or service, can after 
authentication access their security asset or financial asset, such as changing security 
configuration; or 
— a member of specific authorized groups can after authentication access a security asset or 
financial asset; or 
— an entity, authorized by another entity authorized to do so, can access a specific security asset 
or financial asset. 
For the determination of the appropriate access control mechanisms on security assets and financial 
assets the following aspects are important: 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
22 
— the risk associated with an entity’s access to a security asset or financial asset, 
— the form of access an equipment’s functionality allows to a security asset or financial asset, 
— the interface the security asset or financial asset is accessed through and 
— the impact of access control provided by the intended operational environment of use. 
For the determination of entities’ access rights on security assets and financial assets (authorized entities 
for certain access on assets), the following aspects are important: 
— the risk associated with an entity’s access to a security asset or financial asset, 
— the “need-to-know principle”: Does an entity need to obtain some information from a security 
asset or financial asset, 
— the “need-to-use principle”: Does an entity have a valid need to use a functionality based on a 
security asset or financial asset, 
— the “least privileges principle”: everything is forbidden unless permitted, 
— the equipment’s clearly advertised functionality e.g., concerning accessibility of security 
assets or financial assets or interoperability with components of an existing infrastructure.

[AUM-1-2] Requirement user interface 
Access control mechanisms required per ACM-1 shall use authentication mechanisms for managing 
entities’ access via user interfaces that allow to: 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
26 
— read confidential financial data, confidential financial function configuration or confidential 
security parameters; or 
— modify sensitive financial data, sensitive financial function configuration or sensitive security 
parameters; or 
— use financial functions or security functions. 
6.2.1.3 
[AUM-1-3] Requirement machine interface 
Access control mechanisms required per ACM-1 shall use authentication mechanisms for managing 
entities’ access via machine interfaces that allow to: 
— read confidential financial data, confidential financial function configuration or confidential 
security parameters; or 
— modify sensitive financial data, sensitive financial function configuration or sensitive security 
parameters; or 
— use financial functions or security functions. 
6.2.1.4 
Rationale 
The equipment needs to provide an authentication mechanism such that the corresponding access 
control mechanism prevents unauthorized access to assets that can be used for fraud from entities which 
are not who or what they claim to be. 
6.2.1.5 
Guidance 
Authentication mechanisms might use different layers (e.g., application or network layer) for verifying 
the validity of entities’ claims. The management of associated access rights for entities are addressed by 
access control mechanisms. 
There are different kinds of entities that can interact with the equipment, e.g.: 
— a specific human, owner of a user account, device or service; or 
— a member of specific groups such as an authorized group to access a specific equipment’s 
resource; or 
— authorised by another entity to access a specific equipment’s resource. 
Typically, the verification of an entity is based on examining evidence from one or more elements of the 
categories: 
— knowledge (something you know); and 
— possession (something you have); and 
— inherence (something you are). 
A trust relation to a network (e.g., an entity owns a shared secret like Wi-Fi credentials) could be used to 
authenticate an entity. 
Authentication might not be needed for all accesses to security assets or financial assets. 
Examples of access where authentication might not be mandatory are amongst others: 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
27 
— reading information which is clearly advertised as publicly accessible information related to the 
intended equipment functionality; or 
— reading a public key.

6.2.2  [AUM-2] Appropriate authentication mechanisms 
6.2.2.1 
[AUM-2-1] Requirement one factor authentication 
Authentication mechanisms that are required per AUM-1-1 (network interface), AUM-1-2 (user 
interface) or AUM-1-3 (machine interface) shall verify an entity’s claim based on evidence derived from 
at least one element of the categories knowledge, possession and inherence (one factor authentication). 
6.2.2.2 
[AUM-2-2] Requirement two factor authentication 
Authentication mechanisms that are required per AUM-1-1 (network interface) or AUM-1-2 (user 
interface) for access to financial functions via user interfaces over network interface that transfer money, 
monetary assets or virtual currencies shall verify an entity’s claim based on evidence derived from at least 
two different elements of the categories knowledge, possession and inherence (two factor 
authentication). 
6.2.2.3 
Rationale   
One factor authentication is suitable to prevent unauthorized access to security assets or financial assets 
that can be used for fraud from entities which are not who or what they claim to be. The management of 
associated access rights for entities is addressed by access control mechanisms. 
The ability to perform financial transactions over a network needs strong user authentication to deny 
fraudulent transactions over the network e.g., based on weak user passwords. Therefore at least two 
factor authentication is required in this case. 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
37 
6.2.2.4 
Guidance 
Examples for a verification of an entity’s claim based on examining evidence from one element of the 
categories, knowledge, possession and inherence, are: 
— PIN-Code used for user interface 
— 1-Factor (e.g., password based) of each incoming connection on a user or network interface 
— fingerprint biometrics or face recognition for a user interface 
— verifying the possession of a private key that matches to a trusted certificate 
— trust relation to a network (e.g., based on a common secret) established at on-boarding. 
Examples for a verification of an entity’s claim based on evidence derived from at least two different 
elements of the categories, knowledge, possession and inherence, are: 
— Password + OTP 
— PIN + Smartcard 
— Password + Token 
If a user is accessing the equipment through a software application running on another device, such as a 
maintenance application running on a server or laptop, this can, depending on the architecture, be 
considered a software process accessing the equipment. Hence, the authentication for software processes 
can apply. Strong authentication, including possibly multi-factor authentication, can be used for the user 
to authenticate to the external software application. It is also possible to use cryptographic measures to 
create a trust relationship between the equipment and another device such that the possession of the 
other device can be considered as one authentication factor. The two-factor authentication to access the 
equipment might be ensured through another device in the operational environment of the equipment. 
Considering possible constraints of human users with disabilities is an important aspect for 
implementing appropriate authentication mechanisms. Examples of considerations when selecting 
authentication mechanisms include:  
— transferring the authentication information to and from a relevant assistive technology, 
— enabling a dual or shared use when the equipment is in use by a user and a support worker 
(and/or parent and child), 
— offering alternative authentication mechanisms so that they are useable by a user with 
specific learning impairments (including dyslexia) and do not trigger negative feelings (e.g., 
by avoiding specifying family or personal information which may be distressing or not 
relevant for the end user). 
At the time of publishing the present document long passwords like “WeihnachtsmarkTElephanT 
CarpeT2023@Bon(n)” are considered stronger passwords than short passwords like “P@ssw0rd!” and 
more guidance on current best practice on passwords can be found in NIST Special Publication 800-63B 
[10], ISO/IEC EN 27002:2022 [3], ISO/IEC EN 24760 [4], IEC EN 62443-4-2 [2] and ETSI EN 303 645 [6].

6.2.3 [AUM-3] Authenticator validation 
6.2.3.1 
Requirement 
Authentication mechanisms that are required per AUM-1-1 (network interface), AUM-1-2 (user 
interface) or AUM-1-3 (machine interface) shall validate all relevant properties of the used 
authenticators, dependent on the available information in the operational environment of use. 
6.2.3.2 
Rationale 
Even when the equipment provides an authentication mechanism, the risk is given that an attacker uses 
typical design weaknesses to overcome it. The usage of forged or partially forged authenticators are often 
used for an attack against such a mechanism. Therefore, the security design of the mechanisms needs 
techniques to resist forged authenticators, for example manipulated PKI certificates. 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
43 
6.2.3.3 
Guidance  
The authenticator and its attributes can vary depending on the authentication mechanism. For the 
validation of the authenticator, best practice ought to be applied for the corresponding authentication 
mechanism. This is necessary in order to detect and prevent the use of an authenticator that is invalid. 
For example, if the equipment only validates the common name of a PKI certificate without further 
validation of the complete certification information, then a correspondingly forged authenticator would 
be accepted. In this example, the relevant properties of the authenticator are the signatures and public 
keys of the trust chain, the revocation status and in many cases also the validity period of the certificate. 
The set of relevant properties can differ depending on whether the equipment is actually internet 
connected or not. For example, offline equipment probably does not have access to a reliable time source 
or to certificate revocation information. 
Another example for insufficient validation of authenticators is, if only parts of the password is checked. 
This would weaken the strength of the password, facilitating brute force attacks on the corresponding 
authentication mechanism.

6.2.4 [AUM-4] Changing authenticators 
6.2.4.1 
Requirement 
Authentication mechanisms that are required per AUM-1-1, AUM-1-2 or AUM-1-3 shall allow for changing 
the authenticator except for authenticators where conflicting security goals do not allow for a change. 
6.2.4.2 
Rationale 
Static authenticators can be a security risk for the equipment, e.g., increased vulnerability to brute force 
and eavesdropping attacks. Therefore, the support for changing authenticators on the equipment is 
needed as a countermeasure. 
6.2.4.3 
Guidance  
An authorised entity needs the possibility to change the authenticator. The procedure can vary depending 
on the authentication mechanism used.  
— The equipment provides a functionality to the authorised entity, e.g., user, to change the 
authenticator on the equipment. 
— The authenticator, e.g., token, is renewed or changed by the manufacturer and the equipment 
accepts the changed authenticator because the trust chain is still valid. 
— The authenticator is updated using a secure update mechanism. 
In case of machine interfaces new pairing can be necessary. The integration of the change of the 
authenticator in the normal workflow simplifies the procedure for the user. This procedure depends on 
the selected authenticator (e.g., fingerprint, password or token) 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
47 
There can be use cases where a static authenticator is acceptable, such as a root of trust where the 
confidentiality of the corresponding cryptographic key is ensured by the manufacturer. In such an 
example the manufacturer typically provides tokens to authorized entities that are all linked to the same 
root of trust. 
There can also be exceptions, where the overall risk of changing an authenticator e.g., due to complexity, 
outweighs the risk associated with the security assets or financial assets when using static authenticators. 
In such cases, it’s important to consider best practice security design principles to minimize the risk 
associated with the static authenticator, for example, by avoiding the use of global authenticators.   
Depending on the intended equipment functionality it might be needed to ensure the availability of the 
equipment functionality due a deferral option, e.g., not forcing the update of a password whilst driving a 
car.

6.2.5 [AUM-5] Password strength 
6.2.5.1 
[AUM-5-1] Requirement for factory default passwords 
If factory default passwords are used by an authentication mechanism that is required per AUM-1-1, 
AUM-1-2 or AUM-1-3, they shall: 
— be unique per equipment; and 
— follow best practice concerning strength; 
or 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
50 
— be enforced to be changed by the user before or on first use. 
NOTE 
The user can choose to not use any password. 
6.2.5.2 
[AUM-5-2] Requirement for non-factory default passwords 
If passwords other than factory default passwords are used by an authentication mechanism required 
per AUM-1-1, AUM-1-2 or AUM-1-3, they shall: 
— be enforced to be set by the user before or on first use and before the equipment is logically 
connected to a network; or 
— be defined by an authorized entity within a network where access is limited to authorised 
entities; or 
— be generated by the equipment using best practice concerning strength and only 
communicated to an authorized entity within a network where access is limited to authorised 
entities. 
NOTE 
The user can choose to not use any password. 
6.2.5.3 
Rationale 
Weak passwords like universal passwords represent one of the most exploited attack vectors for 
equipment. There is a wide range of malware that uses such passwords to automatically compromise 
equipment. Hence, it is imperative to enforce distinct passwords when set at the factory or user/entity-
defined passwords for each piece of equipment during their initial setup. 
6.2.5.4 
Guidance 
There is a variety of techniques to avoid universal passwords, examples are: 
— The equipment password for the factory default state is printed on a sticker under the 
equipment casing. The password is created by using a True Random Number Generator or 
another 
cryptographically 
secure 
pseudorandom 
number 
generator 
(CSPRNG) 
implementation. 
— The equipment prompts a user to create a password on the first use 
It is highly recommended to follow well established standards for the secure generation of random 
numbers used to generate secure passwords. There are numerous well-recognised publicly available 
standards for random number generation mechanisms which have undergone peer review. Well 
established examples for such standards are NIST SP800-90A[11], NIST SP800-90B[12], NIST SP800-
90C[13], BSI AIS31[18]. 
Guidance on best practice on passwords can be found in NIST Special Publication 800-63B [10],  
EN ISO/IEC 27002:2022 [3], EN ISO/IEC 24760 [4], EN IEC 62443-4-2 [2] and ETSI EN 303 645 [6] 
Unique relates to not systematically reused or deducible for another equipment of the same product type 
and cannot be easily derived from equipment properties (e.g., manufacturer name, model name or Media 
Access Control (MAC) address). Established random generator can be used to generate practically unique 
passwords. 
When enforcing a password change, safety aspects are also relevant, such as not forcing a password 
change while driving a car.

6.2.6 [AUM-6] Brute force protection 
6.2.6.1 
Requirement 
Authentication mechanisms required per AUM-1-1, AUM-1-2 or AUM-1-3 shall be resilient against brute 
force attacks. 
6.2.6.2 
Rationale 
An attacker can try to use mass authentication attempts to overcome an authentication mechanism or to 
impact equipment availability. Therefore, techniques are required to mitigate the impact of such an 
attack. 
6.2.6.3 
Guidance 
Techniques for brute force protection of authentication mechanisms include e.g.:  
— Time delays between consecutive failed attempts to authenticate;  
— A limited number of failed authentication attempts, followed by a suspension period where 
no login is allowed; 
— Multi-factor authentication; 
— Appropriate strength for authentication values based on best practice cryptography; 
— Machine-to-machine authentication might implement mitigation measures such as: 
o long password (more than 16 characters and high complexity); 
o list of allowed IP addresses; 
o  warning/logging mechanism in machine-to-machine interface. 
— Depending on the implemented techniques related risks concerning "resource exhaustion" 
and “denial of service” need to be considered. 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
58 
Consideration is to be given to mitigating the impact of repeated attempts to gain illegitimate 
authentication and mitigate the blocking of legitimate access by triggering the preceding defence 
mechanism.

6.3 [SUM] Secure update mechanism 
6.3.1 [SUM-1] Applicability of update mechanisms 
6.3.1.1 
Requirement 
The equipment shall provide at least one update mechanism for updating software, including firmware, 
affecting security assets and/or financial assets, except for software: 
— where functional safety implications do not allow updatability; or 
— which is immutable; or 
— where alternative measures protect the affected security assets and/or financial assets during 
the entire lifecycle of the equipment. 
6.3.1.2 
Rationale 
Having the ability to provide and deploy software updates through an update mechanism is an essential 
capability. It helps in maintaining equipment, addressing security vulnerabilities, and preventing 
potential exploitation that could compromise the equipment. Such compromises can pose risks to the 
network, disrupt its functioning, or lead to the misuse of network resources, resulting in an unacceptable 
degradation of service.  
However, some parts of the software might be immutable and therefore not updatable for technology 
reasons or functional safety implications do not allow their updatability. Vulnerabilities might also be 
mitigated by alternative measures, such as exchanging vulnerable equipment throughout the entire life 
cycle or being securely mitigated by other equipment that ensures the protection of the security assets 
and financial assets. 
6.3.1.3 
Guidance 
There might be more than one update mechanism for different parts of the software. However, this 
requirement demands at least one update mechanism for each software affecting security assets and/or 
network assets where no except criteria applies. 
Not all software on the equipment can be updatable. This can include software stored in non-updatable 
memory due to the technology or to satisfy functional safety requirements or legal requirements.. 
There are cases where alternative measures exist to prevent harm from potential publicly known 
exploitable vulnerabilities in parts of the equipment’s software or where an exploitable vulnerability in 
its software might not endanger the security assets and financial assets to be protected. For instance: 
— equipment having a replacement strategy, e.g., for equipment with limited resources such as 
sensors that would have to work on battery for many years; or 
— equipment or parts of the software, which can and are foreseen to be securely isolated; or 
— the system of which the equipment is part of mitigates the exploit of any vulnerability. 
Where it is possible, it is good practice to implement a software update mechanism that allows for 
separate security related software updates and application software updates.

The purpose of this assessment case is the functional assessment whether the equipment supports 
update mechanisms for parts of the software affecting security assets and/or financial assets as 
documented in [E.Info.SUM-1.PartOfSoftw.SUM]. 
6.3.1.4.6.2 Preconditions 
The equipment is in an operational state.  
For each update mechanism described in [E.Info.SUM-1.PartOfSoftw.SUM], the manufacturer provides 
updated software (in the following: SW-a) which is integrity-protected and authenticity-protected using 
a mechanism that the equipment natively supports.

successful for an update mechanism documented in [E.Info.SUM-1.PartOfSoftw.SUM]. 
The verdict NOT APPLICABLE for the assessment case is assigned otherwise. 
6.3.2 [SUM-2] Secure updates  
6.3.2.1 
Requirement 
Each update mechanism as required per SUM-1 shall only install software whose integrity and 
authenticity are valid at the time of the installation. 
6.3.2.2 
Rationale 
A secure software update mechanism ensures that the software that controls the equipment is not 
tampered via attacks on the update mechanism. 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
65 
6.3.2.3 
Guidance 
A common approach for confirming that an update is valid is to verify, cryptographically, its integrity and 
authenticity based on a trust anchor. This can be done on the equipment or by another equipment that is 
trusted to perform this verification. For the latter the verified update is typically sent over a secure 
channel to the equipment, securely installed on the equipment. 
NOTE 
A “Secure channel” typically preserve the security properties of the communicated information and can 
also include authorized and authenticated personnel providing the validated software update locally (example of 
technical or organisational measures). 
A manufacturer can provide a secure method to install alternative software not provided by the 
manufacturer themselves, for example allowing a user to install alternative software on a home router.  
It is a security best practice to prevent downgrading the software to an older version.  
Due to some security update the product might return to default setting requiring to re-enter credentials 
and configuration data. 
The use of SCM-3 is appropriate when a software update contains confidential cryptographic keys.

6.3.3 [SUM-3] Automated updates 
6.3.3.1 
Requirement 
Each update mechanism that is required per SUM-1 shall be capable of updating the software: 
— without human intervention at the equipment; or 
— via scheduling the installation of an update under human approval; or  
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
69 
— via triggering the installation of an update under human approval or supervision where there 
is the need to prevent any unexpected damage in the operational environment.  
6.3.3.2 
Rationale 
In case of an existing publicly known exploitable vulnerability in the equipment, that can compromise 
security assets and financial assets, an automated update mechanism can ensure that an available 
security update that addresses this vulnerability is applied without or with minimal human intervention 
preventing the vulnerability exploitation. 
6.3.3.3 
Guidance 
This requirement demands at least one automated update mechanism for each software where SUM-1 
requires an update mechanism. 
NOTE 1 
One automated update mechanism can be used to update multiple parts of the software. 
Automated updates are carried out by machines without needing or with minimal human control or 
intervention.  
Automatic updates are a step further where the equipment makes decisions and executes updates on its 
own without human intervention.  
In specific cases involving safety or time-critical aspects, or dependency on compatibility of the updates 
in a network, the update can require some precautions and/or on-site verifications before it is initiated 
and therefore cannot be performed in an automatic way so that the operation of the application is not 
affected. In such cases, human intervention to trigger or schedule the update is needed. 
In case the installation of the new software version fails, e.g., validation of the software image(s) is un-
successful, best practice is to apply a roll-back policy to re-activate the previous software version, unless 
not enough memory is available to store the update. 
Triggering the installation of an update under human approval can for example consist of displaying a 
notification that an update is available and prompting the user to install the update via a secure update 
mechanism. 
Simple automated updates from a user’s perspective improve the distribution rate of security updates. 
NOTE 2 
“Simple from a user’s perspective” can include: 
— simple configuration of notifications related to the secure update mechanism, 
— simple configuration of the update mechanism and 
— simple provision of consent to fully automatic updates 
Where fully automatic update mechanisms are possible, asking for user’s consent to activate it when 
putting the equipment into service, improves the distribution rate of security updates. 
Checking the availability of new security updates after initialization and regularly improves the 
distribution rate of security updates.

6.4 [SSM] Secure storage mechanism 
6.4.1 [SSM-1] Applicability of secure storage mechanisms 
6.4.1.1 
Requirement 
The equipment shall always use secure storage mechanisms for protecting the security assets and 
financial assets persistently stored on the equipment, except for persistently stored security assets and 
financial assets where: 
— the physical or logical measures in the target environment ensures the security asset or 
financial asset stored on the equipment accessibility is limited to authorized entities. 
6.4.1.2 
Rationale 
Secure storage mechanisms protect security assets and financial assets from unauthorized access. If 
security assets or financial assets are not appropriately secured, an attacker can access, tamper or delete 
the assets and compromise the equipment, which might lead to fraud.  
6.4.1.3 
Guidance 
The security assets and financial assets can be protected by e.g.:  
— cryptographic measures like encryption to ensure confidentiality,  
— cryptographic measures like digital signatures to ensure integrity and authenticity, 
— access control using authentication or authorisation,  
— hardware protection measures 
— physical protection measures 
The appropriate protection mechanism depends on the risks associated with the security assets or 
financial assets to be stored and this might depend on: 
— the criticality of the security asset or financial assets; 
— the amount of security assets or financial assets; 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
73 
— the duration for which the security assets or financial assets need to be stored; 
— the intended operational environment of use.  
Removable storage that is not part of the equipment at the moment of placement on the market is not 
considered to be persistent storage but a storage that is meant to be used to move security assets or 
financial assets between different equipment. Physical access to the equipment is required to remove 
such a storage from the equipment. This ensures access to the stored security assets or financial assets is 
only available to authorized entities having physical access to the equipment. 
Persistently stored data, not listed as security assets or financial assets, may be protected by the secured 
storage mechanism but they are out of scope of this requirement.

6.4.2 [SSM-2] Appropriate integrity protection for secure storage mechanisms 
6.4.2.1 
Requirement 
Each secure storage mechanism that is required per SSM-1 shall protect the integrity of security assets 
and financial assets it stores persistently. 
6.4.2.2 
Rationale 
When stored, security assets and financial assets require protection against tampering. If the integrity of 
the security assets or financial assets stored is not appropriately secured, an attacker can manipulate 
those assets, which might lead to fraud, e.g., by misuse of financial data, false attribution, manipulation of 
financial transaction logs, etc.  
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
77 
The integrity protection applies for encrypted as well as for unencrypted storage. 
6.4.2.3 
Guidance 
Data can be protected from tampering by for instance: 
— cryptographic measures like digital signatures, 
— access control, 
— hardware protection measures, 
— physical protection measures.

6.5 [SCM] Secure communication mechanism 
6.5.1 [SCM-1] Applicability of secure communication mechanisms 
6.5.1.1 
Requirement 
The equipment shall always use secure communication mechanisms for communicating security assets 
and financial assets with other entities via network interfaces. 
6.5.1.2 
Rationale 
The security assets or financial assets of the equipment may be communicated to other communication 
partners for example when using web services. Ongoing communication, potentially enables an attacker 
having access to the communication to eavesdrop, manipulate or replay the communication, especially 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
87 
when using wireless technologies. The equipment needs to ensure that the communication is protected 
against those attacks using secure communication mechanisms. 
6.5.1.3 
Guidance 
There are various technologies that can be applied to secure the communication (see also CRY-1) of the 
equipment. Best practice communication protocols with corresponding configuration ought to be applied 
to protect the communication against eavesdropping, manipulation, and replay. Typical measures 
therefore are a combination of authentication, integrity protection, encryption and replay protection. The 
measures can for example be applied to the communication channel or used for end-to-end protection. 
The equipment needs to offer best practice communication protocols to other communication partners 
by default. The way in which the initial relationship of trust is established between the equipment and 
another entity is crucial for the security of the subsequent communication.

6.5.2 [SCM-2] Appropriate integrity and authenticity protection for secure communication 
mechanisms 
6.5.2.1 
Requirement 
Each secure communication mechanism that is required per SCM-1 shall apply best practices to protect 
the integrity and authenticity of the security assets and financial assets communicated. 
6.5.2.2 
Rationale 
During communication security assets and financial assets require protection against manipulation. An 
attacker having gained access to the network might intercept and tamper the communication (man-in-
the-middle attack). The equipment needs to ensure that the communication is protected against those 
attacks by using integrity and authenticity protection measures. The protection could be realized by the 
protocol used to communicate the security assets or financial assets or by an additional 
protocol/additional measures.  
The integrity and authenticity protection applies for encrypted as well as for unencrypted 
communications. 
6.5.2.3 
Guidance 
In the context of secure communication, “best practice” addresses that approved protocols with 
corresponding configuration (see also CRY-1) are used and that the implementation of the protocol is 
regularly reviewed for vulnerabilities (see GEC-1). 
The aim is protected the communication against manipulation. Typical measures are a combination of 
authentication and integrity protection. The way in which the initial relationship of trust is established 
between the equipment and another entity is crucial for the security of the communication. The measures 
can for example be applied to the communication channel or used for “end-to- end” protection. Further, 
integrity and authenticity protection of communicated is typically realized by using Cipher-based 
Message Authentication Code (MAC) techniques. 
The equipment needs to provide best practice to other communication partners by default.  Appropriate 
measures may differ between the underlying use cases of the communication to fulfil the equipment’s 
intended equipment functionality.  
Examples for approved protocols which can be used to implement secure communication when best 
practice configuration (see also CRY-1) is applied are:  
— Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
— Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)  
— Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)  
— Symmetrical Cipher Methods (e.g., Advanced Encryption Standard – AES) 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
92 
Insecure communication is often not caused by flaws in the protocol but by errors in its implementation. 
Therefore, requirement GEC-1 is important. 
6.5.2.4 
Assessment criteria 
6.5.2.4.1 Assessment objective 
The assessment addresses the requirement SCM-2. 
6.5.2.4.2 Implementation categories 
[IC.SCM-2.ManufSecret]: The method is to introduce the (initial) secret used to ensure integrity and 
authenticity of communicated financial assets and security assets during the production of the 
equipment. The secret is individual for an equipment and is only used inside it. The protection of integrity 
and authenticity itself is realized as channel or message based with a message authentication code based 
on the secret. 
[IC.SCM-2.SecChanExchange]: The method to exchange initial secrets relies on an independent channel:  
The  (initial) secret used to ensure integrity and authenticity of communicated financial assets and 
security assets is solely exchanged via a second channel which is independent from the communication 
mechanism. The protection of integrity and authenticity itself is realized as channel or message based 
with a message authentication code based on the secret. 
EXAMPLE 1 
Input of a shared key through a QR Code or manual entry of a secret 
[IC.SCM-2.PKI-based]: The method to authenticate the certificate used to ensure integrity and 
authenticity of communicated financial assets and security assets is solely based on the signature of the 
certificate issued by a trusted PKI. The protection of integrity and authenticity itself is realized channel 
or message based with a message authentication code based on the secret. 
EXAMPLE 2 
Usage of X.509 PKI-Certificates for TLS 
[IC.SCM-2.ThirdPartyTrust]: The method to authenticate the (initial) secret used to ensure integrity and 
authenticity of communicated financial assets and security assets is solely based on an existing trust 
relation to a third party which confirms the authenticity of the secret. The protection of integrity and 
authenticity itself is realized channel or message based with a message authentication code based on the 
secret.

6.5.3 [SCM-3] Appropriate confidentiality protection for secure communication mechanisms 
6.5.3.1 
Requirement 
Each secure communication mechanism that is required per SCM-1 shall apply best practices to protect 
the confidentiality of communicated financial assets and security assets where confidentiality protection 
of those is needed. 
6.5.3.2 
Rationale 
During communication, financial assets and security assets require protection against eavesdropping. An 
attacker having gained access to the network over which the equipment communicates security assets or 
financial assets might monitor the communication. The equipment needs to ensure that the 
communication is protected against those attacks by providing confidentiality.  
6.5.3.3 
Guidance 
In the context of secure communication, “best practice” addresses that approved protocols with 
corresponding configuration (especially concerning the integrated cryptography, see CRY-1] are used 
and that the implementation of the protocol is regularly reviewed for vulnerabilities (see GEC-1). 
There are various security mechanisms that can be applied to secure the confidentiality of the 
communication (see also CRY-1). Best practice configuration ought to be applied to protect the 
communication from eavesdropping. This is typically achieved by symmetric encryption schemes. Those 
schemes can be applied to the communication channel or used for “end-to-end” protection. It is 
recommended to provide confidentiality by default between the communicating entities and to use best 
practice cryptography. Appropriate measures may differ between the underlying use cases of the 
communication to fulfil the equipment’s intended equipment functionality.  
If confidentiality needs to be preserved for a long period of time it is recommended to use cryptography 
and cryptographic protocols best practices which enforce perfect forward secrecy for financial assets and 
security assets communicated.  
The cryptographic schemes used to protect the confidentiality of the data communicated is determined 
in the requirement CRY-1. 
NOTE 
Authenticated encryption (AE) can be used to assure data confidentiality and authenticity in one 
cryptographic scheme. Those schemes may be used to address the requirement in SCM-2 as well.

6.5.4 [SCM-4] Appropriate replay protection for secure communication mechanisms 
6.5.4.1 
Requirement 
Each secure communication mechanism that is required per SCM-1 shall apply best practices to protect 
the security assets and the financial assets communicated against replay attacks, except for 
communicating security assets or financial assets where: 
— a duplicate transfer does not impose a threat of a replay attack. 
6.5.4.2 
Rationale 
A replay attack is a form of network attack in which valid data transmission is maliciously repeated. An 
attacker having gained access to the network might record the communication and replay it unchanged, 
causing undesired effects at the receiving entity. A replay attack poses a threat in particular if 
authentication can be undermined or unauthorized control commands can be submitted. 
For example, if, during a login process of a user the password is communicated encrypted, but without 
replay protection (especially session hijacking protection), an attacker may be able to replay the 
encrypted login part of the communication, and thus gain maliciously authorized access to the system. A 
session hijacking attack consists of the exploitation of the web session control mechanism, which is 
normally managed for a session token. 
The equipment needs to protect the communication against that class of attacks. 
Based on a risk assessment use cases might be identified for which a replay protection might not be 
needed, e.g., when the data communicated does not lead to a state change at the receiving entity. For 
example, the request to retrieve an X.509 certificate from a server might not pose a risk for a replay attack. 
6.5.4.3 
Guidance 
Replay attacks can typically be prevented by tagging each message of a communication session with a 
session ID and a counter. The session ID prevents replay attacks of the complete communication, while 
the counter prevents the replay of a specific messages within a communication session. Further, 
timestamps or a one-time encryption technique can be used to prevent replay attacks. Nevertheless, the 
implementation of replay attack protection is complex. Therefore, the usage of approved protocols which 
provide already replay attack protection needs to be considered first. Examples for approved protocols 
which can be used to implement secure communication when best practice configuration (see also CRY-
1) is applied are: 
— Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
— Secure Socket Shell (SSH) 
— Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) 
6.5.4.4 
Assessment criteria 
6.5.4.4.1 Assessment objective 
The assessment addresses the requirement SCM-4. 
6.5.4.4.2 Implementation categories 
[IC.SCM-4.SeqNumb]: The sending entity and the receiving entity have already exchanged a secret via a 
trust relation which builds the basis for the message authentication code to ensure the integrity of the 
communication. The method is that a unique sequence number is assigned to each message transmitted. 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
103 
When the recipient receives a message, it checks the sequence number to ensure that it has not been 
received before. If the sequence number has already been seen, the message is discarded as a replay 
attack. 
NOTE 1 
To protect against MitM Attacks the authenticity of the sequence number can be ensured by using it as 
input to the function generating the message authentication code (MAC). 
[IC.SCM-4.TimeStamp]: The sending entity and the receiving entity have already exchanged a secret via a 
trust relation which builds the basis for the message authentication code to ensure the integrity of the 
communication. The method is that the equipment integrates timestamps in messages to ensure that they 
are not being replayed at a later point in time. The recipient checks the timestamp to make sure that the 
message was not generated too far in the past or future. 
NOTE 2 
To protect against MitM Attacks the authenticity of the timestamp can be ensured by using it as input to 
the function generating the message authentication code (MAC). 
[IC.SCM-4.OneTimeEncKey]: The sending entity and the receiving entity have already exchanged a secret 
via a trust relation which builds the basis for the message authentication code to ensure the integrity of 
the communication. The method is that the equipment and the receiver establish a completely random 
session key, which is a type of code that is only valid for one transaction and cannot be reused. 
[IC.SCM-4.Generic]: The methods to avoid replay attacks concerning communicated financial assets 
security assets do not solely rely on any of the methods described before in this section.

6.6 [LGM] Logging Mechanism 
6.6.1 [LGM-1] Applicability of logging mechanisms 
6.6.1.1 
Requirement 
The equipment shall use logging mechanisms for internal activities that are relevant to financial assets 
and their protection (referred to as events), except for: 
— internal activities where a legal obligation prohibits logging. 
6.6.1.2 
Rationale 
To provide information about such events, the equipment will generate relevant logs. Such log 
information can be of support to help to identify e.g., potential unusual equipment behaviour, 
security/data breaches. 
6.6.1.3 
Guidance 
The manufacturer determines the purpose (and audience) for which logs might be created, what data 
might be collected and logged, and any log-specific requirements for protecting and handling the log data, 
e.g. provide the data to a SIEM (Security information and event management).  
A subset of the events identified is typically configured to be collected by default. The manufacturer can 
allow the end user to change this logging configuration. 
The following are typical examples of events to be logged: 
— activities on the financial assets such as adding, editing, combining, removing/archiving, 
deleting, changing of password, permitted or denied access attempts, 
— change on settings which can lessen or improve data protection, 
— activation or deactivation of security relevant sensors, 
— events that trigger financial transactions. 
Examples of logging events are: 
— activities on the financial assets such as access, add, edit, remove/archive, delete, 
— unauthorized access attempts. 
Personal data and financial data captured in the logs are to be minimised to those absolutely necessary 
to support investigators investigating security breaches. 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
108 
Products might be designed to prevent an attempt by an attacker to execute an unauthorized physical 
action. Nevertheless, detection, tamper logging and response are essential in the event of a tampering 
Event occurring. 
Further details on logging can be seen in standards such as ISO/IEC27002 [3], Third edition, 2022-02, 
section 8.15. 
NOTE 1 
the following events might be logged: successful and rejected system access events; changes to financial 
data or financial transaction data; files accessed and the type of access, including deletion of important data files.” 
NOTE 2 
event logs might include, where applicable, user IDs, system activities, time stamp and details of relevant 
Events, equipment identity, system identifier and locations, network addresses and protocols.

6.7 [CCK] Confidential cryptographic keys  
6.7.1 [CCK-1] Appropriate CCKs 
6.7.1.1 
Requirement 
Confidential cryptographic keys that are preinstalled or generated by the equipment during its use shall 
support a minimum security strength of 112-bits, except for:  
— CCKs that are solely used by a specific security mechanism, where a deviation is identified 
and justified under the terms of sections ACM or AUM or SCM or SUM or SSM.  
NOTE 1 
Confidential cryptographic key is a defined term. Other secrets, whose disclosure cannot be used for 
fraud, such as secrets solely protecting intellectual property are not covered by the definition of confidential 
cryptographic key.  
NOTE 2 
The requirement refers to all confidential cryptographic keys chosen by the equipment manufacturer 
either directly or imposed by a protocol. For instance, the manufacturer directly chooses/configures the cipher suite 
of TLS protocol to be used by the device, other protocols can impose one single option for cryptographic algorithms 
and their respective keys.  
6.7.1.2 
Rationale 
The equipment can use cryptography and therefore CCKs for many and different purposes like for 
authentication to enforce access control to security assets or financial assets, for protecting the 
confidentiality or integrity of security assets or financial assets at rest or when communicated to another 
entity or for the derivation of other CCKs. If the confidentiality of a CCK is compromised the security 
assets and financial assets protected by the CCK can get compromised too. A CCK of an equipment 
generated for an algorithm used for cryptographic protection is appropriate when a successful attack on 
it does not affect other CCKs used or generated by this equipment or by other equipment and the 
algorithm has an adequate security strength using this CCK to resist attacks proportionate to its use and 
targeting to break its confidentiality. 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
120 
6.7.1.3 
Guidance 
The security strength supported by a CCK depends mainly on 3 parameters:  
— the entropy of the RNG used for their generation; and  
— its effective length (see BSI TR-02102-1 [20]); and  
— on the cryptographic algorithm with which it is used.  
Another important aspect which is related to the needed security strength supported by a CCK is the 
lifetime of the CCK. Long term CCKs which are stored and used repeatedly for a long period of time would 
need a longer in time resistance against attacks compared to short term CCKs which are usually generated 
on the equipment and only used for a short time. For instance, session keys used for a single 
communication session to encrypt the transferred security assets or financial assets are a typical example 
for short term keys. However perfect forward secrecy is an aspect that usually is taken into account for 
the security of session keys and so these are usually generated/derived with adequate cryptographic 
mechanisms so that session keys of past sessions cannot be compromised. 
Refer to CRY-1 for guidance on best practice. 
Additional good security practices need also to be taken into account. For instance, it is a good security 
practice to use one CCK for a single purpose. Special care is to be taken for CCKs which are not used 
anymore, for instance these are to be deleted. It is recommended to follow recognised best practices for 
that, see CRY-1 requirement. It is also recommended that the same CCK is not replicated and used on the 
different specimens/units of this equipment.  
There may be cases where deviations from the minimum security strength of 112 bits of CCKs is justified. 
For instance, CCKs which are derived from human generated passwords may not provide 112 bits of 
security strength. Password key derivation is used in applications and protocols because they are 
practical and provide adequate security for their use case. There might be also cases where for 
interoperability reasons security measures dictates the deviation of the minimum security strength of 
112 bits to be provided by CCKs. This can be due to the need for “interoperability support” (e.g., see SCM-
1) or the need for usage of standardized and widely used communication protocols that deviate from the 
best practices.  
For such deviations the resulting risks towards “the protection of the financial assets and/or security 
assets” needs to be assessed.

6.7.2 [CCK-2] CCK generation mechanisms 
6.7.2.1 
Requirement 
The generation of confidential cryptographic keys shall adhere to best practice cryptography, except for:  
— the generation of CCKs for a specific security mechanism, where a deviation is identified and 
justified under the terms of sections ACM or AUM or SCM or SUM or SSM.  
NOTE 
Confidential cryptographic key is a defined term. Other secrets, whose disclosure cannot be used to harm 
the network or its functioning or for the misuse of network resources, such as secrets solely protecting intellectual 
property are not covered by the definition of confidential cryptographic key.  
6.7.2.2 
Rationale 
CCKs that are generated by the equipment and used to protect security assets or financial assets, need to 
be generated appropriately in order to prevent successful attacks based on CCKs with insufficient 
security strength. An appropriate CCK generation mechanism ensures that CCKs have the necessary 
properties based on the associated risks and the operational conditions of the equipment. 
6.7.2.3 
Guidance 
The security strength of a CCK is largely determined by the random number source (the main source of 
entropy) and the random number generator and the key generation/derivation algorithm which generate 
it. 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
124 
Risks related to poor choices of random source, random number generators and key derivation can make 
a CCKs subject to attacks like: 
— guessing a CCK; or 
— brute forcing a CCK; or 
— reconstructing a CCK based on accessible information. 
It is therefore essential that the CCK generation mechanism will not generate CCKs with insufficient 
security strength. A robust CCK generation mechanism relies on a secure RNG providing random 
numbers with sufficient entropy. It is a very complex task to create a securely robust CCK generation 
mechanism and the underlying RNG. It is highly recommended to follow well recognised standards for 
this purpose.  
NOTE 1 
There are various well-recognised standards for key generation mechanisms. For instance, recognised 
best practices for Random Number Generators are NIST SP800-90A[11], NIST SP800-90B[12], NIST SP800-
90C[13], BSI AIS20 [38], BSI AIS31[19], ISO/IEC 18031 [39]. 
NOTE 2 
Examples for well-recognised best practices for key derivation are for instance described at SOG-IS 
Crypto Evaluation Scheme Agreed Cryptographic Mechanisms [22]. Alternatives are available here: ISO/IEC 11770

6.7.2.4.6 Functional sufficiency assessment 
There is significant complexity surrounding the validation of cryptographic key generation mechanisms 
and typically they will be implemented by a third party with significant cryptographic expertise, who is 
unlikely to share details of such key generation processes. Given these considerations, no functional 
sufficiency assessment is provided for this requirement. 
6.7.3 [CCK-3] Preventing static default values for preinstalled CCKs  
6.7.3.1 
Requirement 
Preinstalled confidential cryptographic keys shall be practically unique per equipment, except for:  
— CCKs that are only used for establishing initial trust relationships under conditions controlled 
by an authorized entity; or 
— CCKs that are shared parameters required for the equipment’s intended functionality. 
NOTE 
Confidential cryptographic key is a defined term. Other secrets, whose disclosure cannot be used for 
fraud, such as secrets solely protecting intellectual property are not covered by the definition of confidential 
cryptographic key. 
6.7.3.2 
Rationale 
Equipment can use cryptography and therefore CCKs to protect the security assets and financial assets 
on the equipment. The CCKs are sometimes predefined, e.g. in the manufacturing process. CCKs used for 
the above-mentioned purpose need to be appropriate to prevent successful attacks based on CCKs with 
insufficient strength, especially when preinstalled. 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
128 
6.7.3.3 
Guidance 
CCKs can be preinstalled on the equipment during manufacturing. Preinstalled CCKs that are unique per 
equipment instance and resist brute force attacks can mitigate cyber security risk associated with the 
specific use of the CCK.  
Unique relates to not systematically reused or deducible for another equipment of the same product type 
and cannot be easily derived from equipment properties (e.g., manufacturer name, model name or Media 
Access Control (MAC) address). Established random generator can be used to generate practically unique 
cryptographic keys. 
In some cases, keys are only used for establishing initial trust relationships under conditions controlled 
by an authorized entity or the key as shared parameter is essential to the equipment’s operation, e.g., 
software updates or configuration of the migration for network equipment. In such cases the use of static 
keys can be applicable.

6.8 [GEC] General equipment capabilities 
6.8.1 [GEC-1] Up-to-date software and hardware with no publicly known exploitable 
vulnerabilities 
6.8.1.1 
Requirement 
The equipment shall not include publicly known exploitable vulnerabilities that, if exploited, affect 
security assets and financial assets, except for vulnerabilities: 
— that cannot be exploited in the specific conditions of the equipment; or 
— that have been mitigated to an acceptable residual risk; or 
— that have been accepted on a risk basis. 
6.8.1.2 
Rationale 
Equipment can consist of hardware and software provided by different providers and the manufacturer 
might have insufficient visibility into the security practices of these providers. 
It is essential that the manufacturer can identify publicly known exploitable vulnerabilities in the 
hardware and in the software, both commercial and open-source software, used in the equipment and 
can handle these vulnerabilities. 
6.8.1.3 
Guidance 
To facilitate software vulnerability monitoring, the manufacturer of the equipment keeps technical 
documentation of the software of the equipment, including both open-source software and commercial 
off the shelf components. Likewise, technical documentation of hardware can assist in the identification 
of the hardware vulnerabilities. 
To identify the publicly known exploitable vulnerabilities in the hardware and software of the equipment, 
the manufacturer consults a public vulnerability database (e.g. NIST National Vulnerabilities Database 
https://nvd.nist.gov/ and existing National European Vulnerabilities Databases). 
Different factors the manufacturer considers when assessing the publicly known exploitable 
vulnerabilities, include, but are not limited to: 
— attack surface of the equipment and vectors/paths by which an attacker can gain access to the 
equipment to exploit the vulnerability;  
— the evidence that the vulnerability has been actively exploited or it already has documented 
proof-of-concept or code exploits; 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
132 
— the security capabilities and mechanisms implemented in the equipment which can mitigate 
the exploitation of the vulnerability; 
— the “intended equipment functionality”; 
— the equipment's “intended operational environment of use” including the threat environment 
and the security capabilities and additional countermeasures provided by the environment 
which can mitigate or remediate the exploitation of the vulnerability.

6.8.2 [GEC-2] Limit exposure of services via related network interfaces 
6.8.2.1 
Requirement 
In factory default state the equipment shall only expose  
— network interfaces; and 
— services via network interfaces 
affecting security assets and privacy assets which are necessary for equipment setup or for basic 
operation of the equipment. 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
136 
6.8.2.2 
Rationale 
An important factor for reducing the potential risk that the network resource of the equipment becomes 
compromised for instance to harm the network, are exposed services.  Therefore, these exposed services 
need to be limited to those that are necessary for equipment setup and to operate the equipment in the 
intended operational environment of use. 
6.8.2.3 
Guidance 
The configuration of equipment can vary depending on the purpose of the equipment. 
Generally, a differentiation is to be made between two types of equipment: 
— Multipurpose equipment, e.g., smartphones, laptops: Offered services and functionality of 
multipurpose equipment are only under the control of the manufacturer until the equipment 
is placed on the market; and 
— Equipment with a controlled fixed functionality, e.g., sensors, routers: Offered services and 
functionality of the equipment are embedded in an equipment-specific software which is 
provided by the manufacturer. 
In case of equipment with a controlled fixed functionality only network interfaces or services (via 
network interface) are allowed in factory default state to be exposed which are essential to setup or use 
this functionality.  
A multipurpose equipment has no specific intended use but is typically delivered by the manufacturer 
with a defined set of pre-installed applications. Further, the equipment provides an operational system 
for the following typical use cases in the factory default state: 
— Manage/control the hardware of the equipment, 
— Usage of the pre-installed applications, 
— Installation of additional applications, 
— Installation of software update. 
These use cases define the permitted scope for the exposed network interfaces and services (via network 
interfaces).  
Affecting security assets means that if the network interface or the service (via network interfaces) is 
compromised it can have an impact on the security of the equipment.

6.8.6 [GEC-6] Input validation 
6.8.6.1 
Requirement 
The equipment shall validate input received via external interfaces if the input has potential impact on 
security assets and/or financial assets. 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
149 
6.8.6.2 
Rationale 
The equipment needs to validate any input which has potential impact to security assets or financial 
assets to mitigate potential misuse, corruption, or unauthorized extraction of data on security assets and 
financial assets. 
Input validation is necessary to validate for instance the syntax, length and content of any input data that 
is provided as expected input and has the properties that are required to process the data correctly.  
Improper input validation is regarded as one of the most common and dangerous software weaknesses 
which also contributes to several other software weaknesses like out-of-bounds write, and improper 
neutralization which can lead to various injection vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, OS command 
injection and path traversal). 
Especially data from potentially untrusted sources like any input received via network interfaces, need 
to be subject to input validation by checking the input for both syntax and semantics correctness. These 
checks ought to be done as early as possible when processing any input to avoid propagating invalid and 
perhaps even malicious input.  
6.8.6.3 
Guidance 
Improper input validation is one of the root causes for many security vulnerabilities, input can only be 
successfully processed when it has been established that the input is valid by checking the syntax and 
semantics of the input, both on the raw data and metadata.  
Syntax validation is checking that the input is delivered in the correct structure, for instance: 
— the format of a date entry (e.g., dd-mm-yyyy or mm-dd-yyyy); 
— the use of a decimal point or comma in a numeric input; 
— the length of input; 
— correct headers and structures for various file types (e.g., validate a .ZIP., .BMP or .JPEG file 
structure); 
— a valid json, xml or html file. 
Semantics validation is checking that the input is delivered with correct values, for instance: 
— a value that is outside the expected range (e.g., a number that is too small or too large, a 
birthday in the future); 
— special characters which are not allowed in a text input, e.g., special escape characters used 
for SQL injection; 
— incorrect data size and offset values in a structure (e.g., an incorrect size might cause a buffer 
overrun when data is copied without checks, or a negative offset might copy incorrect data 
from the stack); 
— inclusive listing (also known as “allow listing”) is a method which only permits defined input 
(e.g., specified values or expressions), everything else will be rejected as input. 
Using parsers and/or regular expressions are methods to validate for instance text input. A developer 
could also consider other techniques to ensure an input can be successfully processed such as filtering 
and encoding.

6.8.7 [GEC-7] 
This clause is intentionally left blank. 
6.8.8 [GEC-8] Equipment Integrity 
6.8.8.1 
Requirement 
Equipment, which processes financial data, shall cryptographically verify the boot process integrity and 
authenticity of its software (provided by the manufacturer or its sub-contractor), using a root of trust 
which is immutable or, mutable under cryptographically authenticated authorization, for each part of its 
software which processes financial assets and security assets. 
6.8.8.2 
Rationale 
Boot integrity validation is a useful feature in many products to ensure that the software can start up in 
a known verified state. It also detects a corrupted or modified software by an attacker during the start-
up, restarting or resuming after standby (or hibernate) of the equipment’s software. Attacks of this type 
can be used to alter the software operation with a view to accessing or altering the financial assets.  
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
154 
In conjunction with the supervisor function(s) to restart the equipment’s processor(s) and the boot 
integrity function, this provides a robust method of triggering the restoration of authorised software. 
Alternatively, at least an entity can be informed, that the software is not authenticated, and the equipment 
can be considered as corrupted, and thus it cannot be trusted. 
6.8.8.3 
Guidance 
There are a variety of ways of implementing a root of trust, typically using a hardware-based root of trust. 
The critical property of such a root of trust being that of its immutability or only being mutable under 
cryptographically authenticated authorization. 
Such boot integrity checks are independent of each other. For example, where there is more than one 
processor in a piece of equipment and where multiple processors process financial data, all these 
processors will need to validate the integrity of their boot processes before carrying out any functional 
interactions. 
When several parts of the software used to process the financial assets and security assets, typically, 
when several software (on the same processor) are used, the authorized software can verify the integrity 
and authenticity of the software that is started/launched. This is needed to create a Chain of Trust that 
processes the financial assets and security assets.

6.9 [CRY] Cryptography 
6.9.1 [CRY-1] Best practice cryptography 
6.9.1.1 
Requirement 
The equipment shall use best practice for cryptography that is used for the protection of the security 
assets or financial assets, except for: 
— cryptography used for a specific security mechanism, where a deviation is identified and 
justified under the terms of sections ACM or AUM or SCM or SUM or SSM. 
6.9.1.2 
Rationale 
Cryptography that is not strong enough for a use case, e.g., because it is not suitable or broken and used 
for the protection of security assets or financial assets poses a security risk to these assets. Using best 
practices or even more advanced, evidently suitable cryptography supports trust in the cryptographic 
protection of these assets. 
If a cryptographic algorithm is cracked or cryptographic primitives are compromised, it may be necessary 
to update the equipment accordingly (see requirement SUM) in order to preserve the protection of the 
security assets and financial assets the cryptography protects. While there is no absolute guarantee that 
this does not happen to any cryptography that is considered as best practice, it is more likely that 
cryptography becomes unsuitable for a certain use case, when there is already evidence that such 
cryptography might become deprecated within the intended lifetime of the equipment. 
However, e.g., if the equipment can itself communicate over the internet and contains a hardware based 
crypto accelerator, it might not be prepared to update cryptography. In these cases, it is important that 
there is no evidence that the cryptography will not be best practice within the intended lifetime. 
6.9.1.3 
Guidance 
There is various security guidance that can be used to identify best practices for cryptography, see 
respective ISO/IEC standards, publicly available crypto catalogues provided by SDOs and public 
authorities such as sogis.eu, “SOGIS agreed Cryptographic Mechanisms” [24], ETSI TS 119 312 Electronic 
Signatures and Infrastructures; Cryptographic Suites [42] and guidance provided by ENISA and national 
agencies as the NIST SP800 series [8]- [18] and BSI TR-02102-1[20]. 
A commonly used cryptographic method for a certain use case, with the lack of evidence for a feasible 
attack with current readily available techniques, can be considered as best practice. 
However, it is also possible to provide evidence, that new cryptography is suitable for a certain use case 
and can therefore be considered as best practice for cryptography. 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
158 
Cryptography is often used for protecting the relevant security assets and financial assets, for example: 
— Authentication (see AUM), 
— Secure update (see SUM), 
— Secure storage (see SSM), 
— Secure communication (see SCM) and 
— Confidential Cryptographic key Generation (see CCK-2). 
Cryptographic protection might not be compliant with best practice cryptography if interoperability is 
required. Legacy mechanism, that are deployed on a large scale are considered to provide an acceptable 
short – term security and suffer from some security assurance limitations as compared with the identified 
best practice mechanism in the above referenced crypto- catalogues (see e.g., sogis.eu). For up-to date 
lists of legacy mechanism and their validity period given by a deprecation deadline, the crypto catalogues 
are updated on a regular short-term basis (e.g., annually). 
If reviewed or evaluated implementations according to the best practice are publicly available, these may 
be preferable used to deliver network and security functionalities, particularly in the field of 
cryptography. 
To maintain best practices for cryptography within the intended lifetime of the equipment concepts to 
consider are crypto agility additional to the capability of updating cryptography on the equipment in 
accordance to SUM to respond to new attacks and new technological developments.  
Elements to observe for the preparation of updating cryptography are amongst others: 
— cryptographic schemes, protocols, algorithms, constructors and primes, 
— the form of sensitive security parameters being used, and 
— specific SSPs, such as roots of trust. 
For equipment that cannot have their cryptographic algorithms or primitives updated, for example if the 
implementation or part uses a hardware-based root of trust, it is important that the intended lifetime of 
the equipment does not exceed the recommended usage lifetime of the cryptographic algorithms and 
primitives used by the equipment.

Annex A 
(informative) 
 
Rationale 
A.1 General 
This annex provides a rationale for terms and concepts related to this document.  
A.2 Rationale 
A.2.1 Family of standards 
This document belongs to a set of three standards to address the essential requirements defined in 
articles 3.3.d, 3.3e and 3.3.f of Directive 2014/53/EU [34] and activated by the Commission Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2022/30 [35]. By using the Radio Equipment Directive, a first step has been made to 
start to enforce cybersecurity requirements for placing radio equipment on the European market, 
because a lack of security was and is an increasing concern for society, especially for consumer IoT 
equipment.  
While the three standards focus on different essential requirements (harm to the network, personal data 
and privacy and protection from (financial) fraud) there are both unique and overlapping requirements 
in each of them that will require the implementation an increasing number of stronger security controls 
to protect the network, privacy, and financial assets operating within a developing threat landscape.   
Whether one or multiple standards need to be applied to a specific radio equipment is a consideration 
that is made through a product-relevant risk assessment [36] by the economic operator in order to 
identify threats and assess risks on the need to fulfil the essential requirements of the Radio Equipment 
Directive. The Blue guide [35] and RED guide [36] of the European Commission can provide more 
guidance on this topic. 
A.2.2 Security by design 
Effective security management requires established security by design processes, which is not covered 
by this document which defines common security requirements for the equipment. Examples of security 
by design process standards which would aid in the ability to satisfy the security requirements include: 
— IEC 62443-4-1[1]: Security for industrial automation and control systems – Part 4-1: Secure 
product development lifecycle requirements 
— NIST 800-160[17]: Systems Security Engineering; Considerations for a Multidisciplinary 
Approach in the Engineering of Trustworthy Secure Systems 
— NIST 800-218[18]: Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) 
— Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) 
— SAFECode Fundamental Practices for Secure Software Development 
— GSMA FS.16 NESAS Development and Lifecycle Security Requirements

A.2.3 Threat modelling and security risk assessment 
STRIDE is an example of a classification scheme, useful for system decomposition, for characterizing 
identified threats according to the kinds of exploit that are used by the attacker. The STRIDE acronym is 
formed from the first letter of each of the following threat categories:

Each security property has primary mitigation techniques to address the vulnerabilities that could be 
identified by a risk management process. Table A.2 provides the list of mitigations provided as security 
requirements in this document, grouped into the following categories defined by ISO/IEC TR 27103 [40] 
and the NIST cybersecurity framework [41]:  
— Identify: Process of recognizing the attributes that identify the object.  
— Protect: The ability to limit or contain the impact of a potential cybersecurity event. 
o Prevent: Measures that avoid or preclude a cybersecurity event. 
o Limit: Measures intended to reduce the impact of a cybersecurity event. 
— Detect: Security controls intended to detect a cybersecurity event. 
— Respond: Appropriate activities to execute regarding a detected cybersecurity event. 
— Recover: Appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities 
or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity event. 
Table A.2 is a visualisation of the mapping of the threats for each STRIDE category to the mitigations 
achieved by the individual security requirements. The mitigation techniques can be assessed and 
implemented to help ensure it will address the threats identified based on the radio equipment use case 
and intended function.

A.2.4 Functional sufficiency assessment 
Functional sufficiency assessments, where examining and testing for the adequacy of the implementation 
is performed, use different, requirements dependent approaches to facilitate an effective assessment. 
In one approach the assessment units define actions to be performed to identify deviations between the 
documentation within required information and the actual implementation of the equipment under test. 
NOTE 
The conceptual assessment already covers the assessment of the documentation provided with the 
required information with respect to the requirement. 
In another approach the assessment units define actions to be performed to directly assess the 
equipment’s implementation of a requirement to identify potentially deviations e.g., from an attackers 
perspective. 
A.2.5 Implementation categories 
In general, the requirements and assessment criteria are formulated such that different technical 
implementations can be covered. However, certain functional sufficiency assessment units provide, in 
addition to generic assessment units, implementation specific assessment units suitable for common 
technical solutions, referred to as “implementation categories”. 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
165 
A.2.6 Assets 
To ensure requirements can be aligned across the three horizontal standards – each addressing a specific 
scope – assets have been introduced as the main targets against which to apply the requirements. The 
different types of assets are summarised in Table A.3: 
Table A.3 — Assets and essential requirements 
Essential requirement 
3.3.d 
3.3.e 
3.3.f 
Security asset 
 
 
 
Network asset 
 
 
 
Privacy asset 
 
 
 
Financial asset 
 
 
 
 
Protecting an asset is not just about the protection of the specific data stored and communicated or 
otherwise processed by the equipment, but also includes the protection of the functions and the 
configuration of these functions as used by the equipment.  
This correlation is reflected in the definitions for the assets as shown below. 
 
Figure A.1 — Equipment’s financial asset 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
166 
An example for a financial function is the implementation of a function to transfer money between bank 
accounts.  
 
Figure A.2 — Equipment’s security asset 
A security parameter is information used in security functions to protect assets: 
— Per definition, a confidential security parameter (CSP) is secret security related information 
whose disclosure can compromise the security of an asset. Typical examples are PINs and 
passwords, symmetric cryptographic keys or private asymmetric cryptographic keys. 
— A sensitive security parameter (SSP) is security related information whose manipulation can 
compromise the security of an asset. Typical examples are symmetric and 166symmetric 
cryptographic keys or access rights. 
— A public security parameter (PSP) is a sensitive security parameter, that is not confidential. 
Typical examples are public 166symmetric keys.  
— A security parameter can be both sensitive and confidential, and according to the examples 
given above a private symmetric cryptographic key typically falls into this category.  
Security functions are used to protect financial assets or other security assets. For example, the 
implementation of an access control mechanism is a security function. 
In some cases, security functions protect even their own security parameters, e.g., access control might 
be in place before granting access to sensitive or confidential access control security parameters. 
The present document does not determine the granularity of the documentation concerning security 
assets and financial assets. A suitable granularity with respect to efforts in documentation can consider 
common access paths to and access control mechanisms of (groups of) specific assets. For example, 
sensitive security parameters, which are only accessible via a specific API that makes use of a specific 
access control mechanism can be grouped together. 
A.2.7 Mechanisms 
This document uses the concept of mechanisms to address specific security requirements to facilitate the 
applicability and appropriateness of the requirements to different types of equipment implementation 
and use. As this document is a horizontal standard it needs to cover a wide range of products and use 
cases.  
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
167 
If and how generic security objectives are to be achieved depends on the intended equipment 
functionality and the intended operational environment of use. They influence the actual required 
implementation of security measures and the strength of those controls in a specific equipment. A specific 
security measure might be appropriate for a product but might be too weak or strong for other products 
or the same product when used in another environment. 
This document provides specific constraints and assessment questions to guide and avoid the full 
dependence on a manufacturer’s scrutiny towards the necessary security measures to address the 
security concerns related to the intended equipment functionality and the intended operational 
environment of use. 
To guide the user of this document as to when to apply a certain mechanism, the first requirement 
addresses the applicability of the mechanism. These requirements may have an ’except’ component that 
lists the potential conditions for which the mechanism is not required. If it is determined that the 
mechanism is not applicable, then all further requirements in that specific clause are no longer 
mandatory.  
When a mechanism is needed, the sufficiency is determined by evaluating the appropriateness type of 
the requirement and assessment criteria. Any supporting requirements in the clause are applicable as 
well. 
This decision is made for each of the items specified, for example when checking the applicability of a 
requirement on external interfaces, then the decision whether the requirement and all further 
requirements need to be fulfilled is determined for each external interface independently. 
A.2.8 Assessment criteria 
A.2.8.1 General 
The security mechanisms, functionality or other obligations imposed on the equipment have been defined 
in terms as precise and objective as possible, without compromising the technology-agnostic spirit of this 
document. How the manufacturer fulfils each will be documented by providing the inputs for the 
compliance test of the equipment. 
A.2.8.2 Decision trees 
When a mechanism or requirement is applicable and or appropriate is dependent on the intended use 
and intended operational environment of use. This document uses decision trees to aid in the decision 
making and assessment to provide clear direction. An example is shown below. 
 
Figure A.3 — Example decision tree 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
168 
Most decision trees start with the equipment followed by an element to iterate over (e.g., assets above). 
For each of those element’s questions are answered on the characteristics of the equipment or related 
environmental factors. Each decision tree will have at least one or more PASS and FAIL paths and can 
optionally have one or more NOT APPLICABLE paths. A justification for each selected path will have to 
be documented.  
A.2.8.3 Technical documentation 
 The assessments depend on the information to be provided as part of the manufacturer’s technical 
documentation and the results of the applied test methodology prescribed for the respective 
implementation category where present. The specific information elements that need to be included in 
the manufacturers technical documentation for an assessment are indicated as [E.Info.xxxxx] where 
xxxxx indicates the specific desired set of information, for instance [E.Info.ACM-1.ACM] is the 
identification of some of the access control mechanisms’ information to be provided for the assessments 
for the requirement ACM-1 or [E.Info.AUM-1-1.ACM.NetworkInterface] includes a description of network 
interfaces for the assessment for the requirement AUM-1-1. 
Some of the expected general information is: 
— information on the intended equipment functionality  
— equipment’s technical information 
— declared best practice considering the specific use case 
— specific details such as a list of external interfaces 
— security risk assessment 
The assessment of a requirement could require the same or similar information as other requirements 
(e.g., interface information) in this case a reference could be used inside the documentation.  
As input for the assessment the paths through the decision trees are indicated as [E.Info.DT.xxxxxx] and 
the justification is indicated as [E.Just.DT.xxxxxx]. Not all information elements that are indicated might 
be required depending on the selected implementation category and path through the decision tree. The 
table below is just an example of how this could be achieved for a conceptual assessment. 
 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
169 
 
Figure A.4 — Example: Decision Tree Evidence 
A.2.8.4 Security testing  
The adequacy of most security controls is not quantifiable measurable, as there are no equivalents to a 
thermometer or frequency meter to measure the equipment's security posture or strict definitions to 
determine when good is good enough.  
The outcome therefore is dependent on the evaluator’s knowledge and view of the threat landscape and 
what is appropriate for a specific equipment in a specific environment, thereby further contributing to 
the fact that it is difficult to define verifiable, objective, and reproducible test criteria, because even two 
evaluators might have significantly different views and/or opinions.  
Security test tools often use negative testing, demonstrating that certain weaknesses are not manifest, 
but because security tools are continuously updated, new issues might be found with updated 
information or when run for a more extensive period - as such this will also not lead to reproducible test 
results. 
The approach taken in this document, therefore, improves the assessment outcome but cannot resolve 
this issue. Most of the assessments are based on the fact that sufficient information is provided.  
A.2.9 Interfaces 
Interfaces are an essential concept to describe the communication relationship between entities. The 
definitions for the interfaces are structured in a hierarchical manner: 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
170 
Table A.4 — Interfaces 
Definition 
Note 
interface 
Abstract base definition 
external interface 
Definition scoped to the equipment 
 
 
user interface 
Specific interface types scoped to the equipment 
 
 
machine interface 
 
 
network interface 
The hierarchical structure can be described by the following relationships: 
— An “external interface” is an “interface”. 
— A “user interface”, a "machine interface” and a “network interface” are all “external 
interfaces”. 
This document only defines specific interface types that are in the scope of this document. 
For the communication between the equipment and an entity a layered communication model is applied. 
Depending on the use case per communication layer different types of interfaces might be used. 
For example, a web service on the equipment might provide a web page to a device to interact with the 
device’s user. While from the application point of view this is a user interface, the web page is transmitted 
over the network using a network interface. 
The following examples illustrate the approach. 
A.2.9.1 Example: Laptop with a built-in keyboard 
In this example the keyboard is an integral part of the equipment. The equipment communicates with the 
user through a user interface. 
 
Figure A.5 — Example: Laptop with a built-in keyboard 
A.2.9.2 Example: Equipment with a USB-keyboard 
In this example the keyboard is not part of the equipment but is connected via USB. From the perspective 
of the equipment the keyboard is an external device, to which it communicates through a machine 
interface. However, from the application point of view the communication with the user takes place 
through a user interface. 
BS EN 18031‑3:2024
EN 18031-3:2024 (E) 
171 
 
Figure A.6 — Example: Equipment with a USB-keyboard 
A.2.9.3 Example: User interface over a network 
A user is using a device to communicate with the equipment over the network using a keyboard. For this 
example, it is irrelevant, if the keyboard is built-in into the device, or if it is connected by other means to 
the device.  
The equipment is using the network stack to communicate with the user’s device, thus on this layer the 
communication takes place through a network interface. From the application point of view a user 
interface is used between the equipment’s application and the user. 
 
Figure A.7 — Example: User interface over the network 
A.2.9.4 Example: USB-printer 
A printer is connected to the equipment via USB. The example is like the USB-keyboard with the only 
difference that from application point of view the communication takes place through a machine 
interface. 
 
Figure A.8 — Example: USB-printer 
A.2.9.5 Example: Network printer 
In this example the equipment is communicating with a printer reachable over the network. Like for the 
user interface over the network example, it does not matter how the printer is connected to the network. 
On application layer the communication takes place through a machine interface, while from the network 
layer point of view a network interface is used for communication.

B.1 General 
The intention of this informative annex is to provide a mapping between the requirements in this 
document and the Component Requirements (CRs) specified in EN IEC 62443-4-2: 2019 [2] in order to 
support manufacturers who are also applying EN IEC 62443-4-2: 2019 [2]. 
The required security level and applicable requirements are identified as a result of the risk assessment 
performed by the manufacturer. 
Secure product development lifecycle related requirements are specified in EN IEC 62443-4-1:2018 [1] 
and are not addressed in this annex. 
Fulfilment of the EN IEC 62443-4-2:2019 requirements (e.g., documented by a certificate) in itself does 
not provide conformance to the requirements in this document.
